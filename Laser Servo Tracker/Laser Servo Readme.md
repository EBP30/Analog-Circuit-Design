# Tracking Servo
Built control circuitry for a servo mounted laser which functioned to automatically point the laser in the center of a small solar panel regardless of the where the panel was placed within a 5ft radius. The design featured two modes: a searching mode where the laser autonomously moved left and right as if "scanning" for the solar panel, and a found mode where the laser tracks the solar panel while it is moved around. Additionally, two jog buttons were included that acted to manually override the position of the laser by jogging it to the left or right.
