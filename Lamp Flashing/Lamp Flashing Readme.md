**Lamp Dimmer and Flashing circuit:** Designed and built a triac phase-control lamp dimmer that will drive a #194 lamp with full-wave AC.
Use the “13VAC” transformer as the only power supply; a separate power supply is not to be used to power the control circuitry. Lamp brightness is to be controlled by a potentiometer and must be adjustable from completely OFF to full ON. The flashing feature of the circuit does not simply turn on and off the power source but slowly dims to no brightness and full brightens with this control signal.
