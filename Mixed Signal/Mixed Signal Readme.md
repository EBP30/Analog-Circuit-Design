Mixed Signal modulator and demodulator: Designed a circuit that produces a PWM waveform that will be the digital representation of an input signal. This waveform is sent over a transmission channel to a receiver/converter which reconstructs the original signal. The transmitter and receiver will be coupled by an opto coupler which substitutes for an optical fiber link or other digital transmission channel.
