**Function Generator:** Designed a “Function Generator” that produces sine, square, triangle, and pulse waveforms. A sketch of an imaginary front panel is shown below

**Sine, triangle, and square wave outputs:** 0 to 20Vpp, adjustable with the “Amplitude” control. Source and sink 50mA. Rise and fall time of the square wave is  < 100usec, measured with .01μFd across output

**Pulse Output:** 0 to 10Vpk. Source and sink 200mA. Rise and fall time of the pulse waveform is < 100 nsec, measured with 1000 pFd across output. The Pulse Output has its own “Amplitude” control. The “Duty Cycle” control applies to the pulse waveform only, and should adjust from approximately zero to 100%.
