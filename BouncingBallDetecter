Bouncing Ball Detector
a circuit that will reliably produce a single LED pulse every time a 3/8‚Äù diameter steel ball 
is dropped Into the heavy plastic base from a height of about 4 inches. Locate the base about 
6 inches from the sensor, and place it in the provided paper plate to catch the ball. Only one 
LED pulse must be produced with each drop of the ball, and the ON time must be independent of 
the audio pulse amplitude.
