# Motor Control
Built a closed loop motor control system using a PID controller, similar to those found in cruise control systems. The design included a hand built digital encoder made from and IR Emittter LED and Detector LED, which allowed the speed of the motor to be observed and conseqently adjusted by the feedback loop. PWM modulation was used to drive the motor.
